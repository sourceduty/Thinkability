[Thinkability](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-kabr1c9j2-thinkability) was developed to evaluate and discuss the level of human-like thought demonstrated by software, particularly in the realms of reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities of different AI systems. By exploring these aspects, Thinkability helps in understanding how various AI technologies mimic or differ from human cognitive processes. This includes discussing AI development trends and cognitive architectures.

If you're interested in AI, Thinkability can offer insights into how different systems are designed to think and make decisions, potentially helping in areas such as:

1. Education and Learning: Helping learners understand complex AI concepts in a simplified manner.
2. AI Development: Providing AI developers and researchers with comparative analyses and discussions on various AI models and their human-like reasoning capabilities.
3. Technology Decision Making: Assisting businesses and technologists in making informed decisions about which AI technologies might best meet their needs based on how closely those technologies mimic human thinking.
